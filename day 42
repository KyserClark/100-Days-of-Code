Another fantastic day of Python learning. Today I spent 3.5 hours going through Chapter 7: User Input and while loops in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. 
Definitely not new concepts for me. However, I did learn a clever new way of accepting user input. 
I also realized that 'continue' inside a while loop doesn't continue the while loop at all. Instead, it stops the while loop in place and returns back to the beginning. 
I thought this whole time, 'continue' meant to run to the next section of the loop. 
This alone probably cause some headaches in my previous programs, so it's really nice to understand it fully. Tomorrow I will continue with the book on to Chapter 8: Functions.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 128 hours
