I have finished the Python Network Programming for Network Engineers Udemy Course by David Bombal. 
The practical network automation was only about half the course. 
So I started out with hands-on scriptings and running scripts to apply configurations to network devices. 
Things the course covered are Netmiko and NAPALM. 
Unfortunately, I wish there were more practical applications using Netmiko and NAPALM, but the course really only covers the basics. 
This is how I know I am getting good at python. 
I put the 2nd half of the course where David Bombal covers the "theory" of Python (Python basics) on 2x speed. 
This is because I already knew everything he was covered from the previous two courses I completed. 
This is how I managed to complete this course in such a short period of time (a few days). 
Next book: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart!

Today was a long nine hours making Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 198 hours
