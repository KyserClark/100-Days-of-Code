#100DaysOfCode Day 12

Spent about an hour and a half trying to figure out why my #Python code wasn't working.

And I found out it's because I don't understand this particular Boolean statement:

cell_list[0] = ' '
print(cell_list[0])

bool(cell_list[0] == 'O' or 'X')
True
print(cell_list[0])


Hopefully I can get an answer to this soon. Very mind boggling to me
