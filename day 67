Continuing along with the Python Network Programming for Network Engineers Udemy Course by David Bombal, 
I discovered the free Cisco Dev Net Labs usable for the course. However, I ran into many issues with this free solution. 
The free Dev Net Labs require Cisco any connect to run. I had a lot of problems with the Cisco Any Connect VPN. 
I was forced to restart my computer a few times, and the one time I did get it working, any connect disconnected a few minutes into my lab. 
With this in mind, I don't want to be randomly kicked off in the middle of my labs during this course, 
so I think I will purchase full image access from Cisco. $200 is a lot of money for a lab, but when it comes to my career as a Network Engineer, 
it's 100% worth it. Tomorrow I will complete the purchase and finally get into real network automation.
