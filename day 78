I took a bit of a break from coding. I'm now back in it and after 1 hour of reading Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. 
I can confidently say that I don't regret the long break, and I still don't really like coding. 
Development just isn't for me. 
I have come to the conclusion that I will only code stuff when I find myself repeating long tedious tasks for days on end. 
Other than that I don't think I will ever develop an entire useful application. I don't have the imagination, desire, or motivation for it. 
And that is ok because I want to be a hacker, not a developer. 
I only need to know basic python for my chosen career 
and I think I'm already past the point I need to know to have a successful ethical hacking career. 
Maybe things will change when I start to read python books specifically tailored to hacking. 
Time will tell. I will complete my 100 days of code, and I will finish this book. No matter how much I may not seem to enjoy it. 


Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 216 hours
