Today was the day I finished my tic tac toe game! My first ever program in any language! 

I didn't look at the solutions, or the "help getting started" content in the Udemy course I have been following. 
Because of this, it took me longer to get a working tic tac toe game. However, I believe I came out a better programmer for choosing the challenging route. 
I ran into many errors and problems during this endeavor, but I understand how python and programming works so much more now.

I spent 7 hours today working on the code and another hour cleaning it up and adding comments for a total of 8 hours. 
So overall, it took me 16 hours across five days to finish the tic tac toe game.

It took 28.75 hours of learning to make this happen. So overall, up to this point, I have spent 44.75 hours working with Python across 13 days. That is 3.44 hours per day. 

Tomorrow I will look at the solutions and the guidance for the tic tac toe game and will follow along and create a new tic tac toe game and take note of any efficiencies I missed along the way doing this milestone without help.
