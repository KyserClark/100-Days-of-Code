Today I started Chapter 12: A Ship That Fires Bullets in in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. 
Early in the chapter, the author mentions that you should use Git for version control for the Alien Invasion game. 
Since I'm very new to Git, I decided to spend today reading Appendix D: Using Git for Version control 
and following along with the "tutorial" by installing Git and going through the basic commands on my own computer. 
I finished my coding session by installing Pygame. Tomorrow I will continue chapter 12 and officially start coding the Alien Invasion game. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 145.5 hours
