Today I finished Chapter 11: Testing Your Code in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. 
It took me about an hour and a half to read the rest of the chapter and complete the last exercise. 
To be honest, I'm not sure of the advantages of the test methods presented in the book over my previous testing method of "trial and error." 
It seems as if the test exercises served no real advantage over running the code a few times and looking at the 'real' results. 
This was all new content to me, as this way of testing was never mentioned in my previous Udemy course, 
so I wonder how other Python developers feel about unittest. 
Chapter 11 completes Part I of the book,  and tomorrow I will start Part II: Projects. There are three projects in Part II. 
Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python, Data Visualization, and Web Applications. 
I have elected to do the projects in order, so I will start with Chapter 12: A Ship That Fires Bullets. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 144.5 hours
