Today I spent about 3 hours in total getting started with my coding journey. 
I began by first creating a Github account (KyserClark). Once I made my Github account, I committed to the 100 days of code challenge publically across social media. 
Next, I filled out my profile information, created the README.me, and completed the Github "Hello World" tutorial where I...
Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request

With the basics of Github out of the way, I started the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla. 

It's worth noting at this point that before I started today, I previously watched the first few videos of the course up to the point where the instructor had me install Anaconda. 
So I hit the ground running today. 

I launched the Jupyter Notebook app inside Anaconda and learned the basics of how it works, and watched an overview of some free browser-based Python resources. 
Today the course showed me:

Running Python Code
How to get course material (notebooks)
Git and Github overview
Introduction to Python Data Types
Python Numbers
I even read Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations in its entirely for better understanding. 

I read the entirety of the 1st chapter of the course book (in Jupyter notebook form). 
Then, I went over the things not covered in the video. 
Lastly, I completed the simple math coding exercise and completed the 3 question quiz.

Tomorrow I start with learning Variable Assignments...
