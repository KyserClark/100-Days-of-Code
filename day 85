I finally finished Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart! 
I read the rest of chapter 20 and am VERY excited to be done with it.

I have officially started the book Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold. 
I completed the introduction sections and chapter 1 which covers virtual machine (VM), Python3, and 
integrated development environment (IDE) installation. All stuff I'm very familiar with. 
Chapter 2, Basic Networking Tools, starts getting into the fun stuff. 

After doing courses and reading books about general python coding (for developers, not hackers), 
it's nice to finally code stuff specifically for hacking. The real reason why I wanted to begin learning python to begin with. 
I'm finally excited about the 100 Days of Code journey once again. 
Automate the Boring Stuff isn't a bad book, but for an aspiring hacker, It was boring. 
Most of the information didn't apply to the tools I want to write. 
This is why it took me so long to complete the book, and I stopped coding at the halfway point of the book 
(and strictly read the book rather than complete the exercises. 
I'm glad to get excited about my coding journey again and finish my last 15 days strong with a great book 
specifically tailored for hackers like myself.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 223 hours
