# Day 88

With 1 hour dedicated to Python coding today, I got through the 3rd section of Chapter 2 in Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold. Today was all about building an SSH Server. Once again, unfortunately, the tool did not work as advertised. I carefully read the book, installing every package that it tells me to in the order it tells me to. I coded along and tried my best to understand the code. I even copied and pasted the code from the author's source code library into my machine. Ensuring I change the IP address to my machine's IP address. But no matter what I do, I can't get this SSH server to run. This is the 2nd application in the book that has failed to work. Furthermore, the source code for the book on the NoStarchPress website is a little different than the code in the book. Neither works. It's just frustrating to see this from such a highly-rated book. It's not like I don't know what I'm doing. I know my way around a Linux machine, Python, as well as Hacking concepts VERY well. I honestly think the book is just flawed. Because of this, I am forced to stop reading the book and finish out my last 12 days of Python code using a different learning source.  


I will switch to Python 101 for Hackers on the TCM Security Academy website. Once I finish Python 101 for hackers, I will level up to Python 201 for Hackers to close out my 100 days of code.


Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 227.5 hours
