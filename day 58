I logged three hours today. I finished Chapter 12: A Ship the Fires Bullets in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. 
I limited the ship's range so it couldn't fly off the screen; I added a 'Q' to quit control, made the game run in fullscreen, 
made the ship fire bullets, and limited the player to only three bullets on screen, once to promote accuracy.  
Once the ship was able to shoot bullets it was time to build a fleet of Aliens in Chapter 13: Aliens! 
At its time, the game has an entire fleet of aliens that do not move and do not disappear when hit by a bullet. 
Tomorrow that will change when I continue and finish chapter 13.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 151 hours
