# Day 99

Today in one hour, I consolidated all my individual blog posts about this 100 Days of Code journey into two separate blog posts. Transferring 96 blog posts takes a lot of time, but well worth it. I wanted to make a single post, but my website wouldn't let me post for more than 75 days, so I was forced to split the journey into two posts. It was nice re-reading all my old posts and seeing how I progressed throughout this journey.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 239 hours
