I didn't do actual coding today. Instead, I spent over an hour installing GNS3 and the GNS3 VM to follow along with 
Python Network Programming for Network Engineers Udemy Course by David Bombal. 

Unfortunately, the Cisco IOS images I need for the course cost $200 and only grants 1-year access. 
This is a very steep and significant cost, especially since it's only good for 365 Days. 
I will sleep on the decision if I want to purchase them or not. I may do it; I may not. 
If I decide not to buy the images, I will proceed with a different Python course. 
However, I am most interested in Python for Network Engineers since I am not a developer. 
I am a Network Engineer and Cybersecurity professional. Therefore, thisThis course will be more beneficial than most other Python courses.
