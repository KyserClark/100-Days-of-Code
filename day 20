Today I put in 3.5 hours into learning Python. Continuing on my path to complete the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla. 


I started with learning  __name__ and "__main__" to finish up section 0: Modules and Packages and then proceeded to go into section 10: 
Errors and Exceptions Handling, which included:

Errors and Exception Handling
Errors and Exceptions Homework
Pylint Overview
Running tests with the Unittest Library

Once section 10 was complete, the next step was going into section 11: Milestone Project - 2. I have watched all Milestone Project 2 Section Warmup videos. The warmup video is a full-fledge game of the War card game where Jose goes through:

Card Class
Deck Class
Player Class
Game Logic - Part One
Game Logic - Part Two
Game Logic - Part Three

Tomorrow I will code along with these warmup videos and create a game of war myself.  

Lastly, I watched the Milestone Project 2 Overview, where Jose tells the student what Project 2 is. 
Project 2 is a one-player Blackjack game where a player plays and bets against a computer dealer. 

Just like Milestone Project 1, I am electing to go with the challenging route. 
This means I will not be looking at the solutions video or following the course guide for assistance while I code out this game. 
This choice will be much harder, take longer, and be more frustrating to go through, but in the end, it will make me a better programmer and force me to understand Python more. 
I need this because I eventually would like to get to an advanced level of understanding in Python. We will see how it goes in the coming days. 
I feel confident in my abilities, but just like the Tic Tac Toe game, I know this will be challenging and rewarding. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 57 hours
