In two hours, I read Chapter 8: Input Validation and Chapter 9: Reading and Writing to files in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart.
Everything in these chapters is something I already knew and already coded out in previous days. 
Because of that, I chose not to do the practice projects for these chapters. Tomorrow I will start with Chapter 10: Organizing Files.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 214 hours
