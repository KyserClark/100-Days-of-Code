Today I logged about 3 hours of Python learning. I am not going to lie. This stuff is starting to get challenging.
I'm trying to decide if I should re-watch course content or press on. Regardless...

Day 5, I completed: 

While loops
Useful Operators
List Comprehensions
Methods and Documentation
Introduction to Functions
def Keyword

on the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.
