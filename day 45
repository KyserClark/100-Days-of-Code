Today I competed about the first quarter of Chapter 9: Classes in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. 
I only had time to put an hour into learning, but that is enough to keep the 100 days of Code streak alive. 
Nothing too crazy, only the basics of classes in python. Tomorrow I will continue Chapter 9. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 132.5 hours
