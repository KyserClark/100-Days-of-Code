I decided not to start the final capstone project; instead, I decided to go over the lectures after the final capstone project to learn more.
So I am proud to say after 105 hours, I have completed the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.  
Today was all about advanced python Objects and Data Structures, as well as an introduction to GUIs. It took me 2.5 hours to complete 17 lectures today.

Tomorrow I will start Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. 

This book is intended for absolute beginners; however, It will do me a lot of good going over the fundamentals again and getting a new perspective from a different instructor. 
There are also three very different projects towards the end of the book, so this book still has a lot of value to me. It's 548 pages long, so it's packed with information. 
Even though I just completed a beginner-level course, I am confident that I will learn and expand my knowledge and reinforce common topics. I can't wait to start it tomorrow. 

It's worth noting that I fully intend on completing some major project with the 10+ remaining days of my 100 Days of Code challenge to complete the 
Final Capstone Project requirement from the Complete Python Bootcamp course. Therefore, I am saving my final project for the end of my 100 Days of code, which makes more sense.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 105 hours
