Today I dedicated a solid 6 hours to learning python.

I'm now 50% complete with the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.  

I learned lambda expressions, map, filter functions, and nested statements and scope.

I completed the methods and functions homework with almost no guidance.
I solved 6/7 problems (86%), not too bad, especially since I solved some of the problems better than the intended solution. 
I also watched all the milestone project warmup videos. 

Tomorrow I will re-watch these milestone project warmup videos and complete the warmup exercises. Then, if there is time, I will begin the milestone project itself.
