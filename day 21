Today was a two-hour Python session. As I said in yesterday's post, I coded along with the warmup videos for Milestone Project 2 in the 
Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.

These videos show how to program a game of War from the ground up:

Card Class
Deck Class
Player Class
Game Logic - Part One
Game Logic - Part Two
Game Logic - Part Three

Tomorrow I officially begin Milestone Project 2, where I create a one-player Blackjack game from scratch. 

Just like Milestone Project 1, I am electing to go with the challenging route. 
This means I will not be looking at the solutions video or following the course guide for assistance while I code out this game. 
This choice will be much harder, take longer, and be more frustrating to go through, but in the end, it will make me a better programmer and force me to understand Python more. 
I need this because I eventually would like to get to an advanced level of understanding in Python. We will see how it goes in the coming days. 
I feel confident in my abilities, but I know this will be challenging and rewarding, just like the Tic Tac Toe game. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 59 hours
