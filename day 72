Today I started to read Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. With the 6.5 hours, I decided to put towards it today. 
I managed to read Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 (148 pages!). 
I still need to do the practice questions and practice projects at the end of Chapter 4 though. Tomorrow I hope to read even more of the book. 
I was feeling off today and I had to do physical therapy as well. 

Here is my code for the Collatz sequence:

def collatz(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        output = (number // 2)

    else:
        output = 3 * number + 1

    print(output)

    if output != 1:
        collatz(output)


while True:
    try:
        user_number = int(input('Enter Number: '))
        break

    except:
        print('Input must be an integer')

collatz(user_number)
