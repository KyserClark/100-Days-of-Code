Got a late start on the day due to YouTube video editing. I wanted to complete both Chapter 19 and 20  in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.  
However, I was only able to get an hour of coding in and I only managed to get about a quarter the way through Chapter 19: User Accounts. 
The web application is in a working state with slightly more functionality for users to add topics and entries.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 168.25 hours
