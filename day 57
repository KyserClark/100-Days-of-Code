I continued Chapter 12: A Ship the Fires Bullets in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. I resized the ship and made it go to the bottom of the screen instead of the top left. I also coded the left and right controls to move the ship left and right. Lastly, I made a setting to adjust the shipping speed if needed. Tomorrow I will continue and finish chapter 12.
