An excellent day of Python learning today; I spent 5 hours going through the rest of the base sections in the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla. 
I completed:  Section 16: Working with Images with Python, Section 17: Working with PDFs and Spreadsheet CSV Files in Python, and Section 18: Emails with Python.
I have made it to the Final Capstone Python Project! 
Jose recommends starting with a small project that will take less than a day and then moving towards a project that will take more than a week. 
Since I try to make my python days as close as three hours as possible, I will do one project that takes less than 3 hours and another project that takes more than 21 hours.  
Still unsure what projects I will do. It is up to me to choose which is the best part of the project. I get to choose something that I think is fun to me.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 102.5 hours
