After over two weeks of not coding, I got back into it. 
The two-week hiatus was due to a lack of interest in coding, TryHackMe focus shift, contracting covid and being sick, starting a new college course, 
and a few personal reasons I won't talk about. I'm glad to get back into the saddle.

Today I read all of Chapter 10: Organizing Files in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. 
I also read about 3/4 of Chapter 11: Debugging. I read all of this in 1 hour's time. For the next day, 
I will finish Chapter 11, and read Chapter 12: Web Scraping.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 215 hours
