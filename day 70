Continuing with the Python Network Programming for Network Engineers Udemy Course by David Bombal, 
I learned some more automation techniques and added five switches to the topology (see figure 1). 
I can successfully configure all six switches simultaneously in any manner I choose. Automation is compelling.
Unfortunately, I spent the bulk of my time trying to get SSH to work. 
Every time I tried to SSH from the Network Automation Container to one of the switches, it would not accept my password. After 5-6 hours. 
I finally discovered that I couldn't SSH into the switches because the Network Automation Container tries to SSH into the root account of the switch by default. 
That means you have to specify the account you want to SSH to make a connection. 
And because I wasn't specifying my 'Kyser' account, and  I didn't have a 'root' account on the switches, I couldn't make an SSH connection. 
Once I realized the reason for SSH not working, I rebuilt the entire topology using 'root' as the only account. 
That way, I don't need to specify a username when I SSH from the Network Automation container to one of the switches. 
Today was a solid 8.5 hours of labbing. Even though I was getting a bit frustrated about a simple SSH connection not connecting, I had fun. 
I'm glad I didn't give up and figured it out. I can now continue the course tomorrow. I'm shooting for another 8-9 hours! 

a script that adds n number of VLANs to every switch specified in 'my switches'

import getpass
import telnetlib

user = input("Enter your telnet username: ")
password = getpass.getpass()

file = open('myswitches')

for ip in file:
    ip = ip.strip()
    print("Configuring Switch " + ip)
    tn = telnetlib.Telnet(ip)
    tn.read_until(b"Username: ")
    tn.write(user.encode('ascii') + b"\n")

    if password:
        tn.read_until(b"Password: ")
        tn.write(password.encode('ascii') + b"\n")

    tn.write(b"conf t\n")

    for n in range(2, 20):
        tn.write(b"vlan " + str(n).encode('ascii') + b"\n")
        tn.write(b"name Python_Vlan_" + str(n).encode('ascii') + b"\n")

    tn.write(b"end\n")
    tn.write(b"exit\n")

    print(tn.read_all().decode('ascii'))
    
    
    
    
a script that reads the running-config and saves it to a file for backup for each switch
    
import getpass
import telnetlib

user = input('Enter your telnet username: ')
password = getpass.getpass()

file = open('myswitches')

for ip in file:
    ip = ip.strip()
    print('Getting running config from Switch ' + ip)
    tn = telnetlib.Telnet(ip)
    tn.read_until(b'Username: ')
    tn.write(user.encode('ascii') + b'\n')

    if password:
        tn.read_until(b'Password: ')
        tn.write(password.encode('ascii') + b'\n')

    tn.write(b'wr\n')
    tn.write(b'terminal length 0\n')
    tn.write(b'show run\n')
    tn.write(b'exit\n')

    readoutput = tn.read_all()
    saveoutput = open('switch' + ip, 'w')
    saveoutput.write(readoutput.decode('ascii') + '\n')
    saveoutput.close()
