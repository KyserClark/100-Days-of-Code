Another hour of Python learning today! I almost finished Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. 
I just need to program the three exercises and read the summary at the end of the chapter, and then I can move on to Chapter 11: Testing Your Code. 
I'm getting pretty excited because I am getting closer to the fun projects for the course.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 140.5 hours
