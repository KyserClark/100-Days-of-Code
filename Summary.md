# Summary
IT'S DONE!!

What a long learning journey that had a lot of ups but also a few downs. The goal was to learn python to be a better hacker and cybersecurity professional. NOT an application developer. And I firmly believe my goal has been accomplished across these 100 days. 


## The stats:

* Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 240 hours
* 5 larger projects
* 176 small projects
* 2.2 Books Read
   * Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes
   * Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart
   * Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold
* 4 video courses completed
   * Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python
   * Python Network Programming for Network Engineers
   * Python 101 for Hackers
   * Python 201 for Hackers
* 2 TryHackMe Rooms
   * Python Basics
   * Python for Pentesters

## Lessons learned:

* I understand how to automate easy but tedious tasks
* I can solve simple problems in a programmatic way
* I know how to take existing hacking exploits and modify them to work for me (NOT A SCRIPT KIDDIE ANYMORE!)
* I understand how to read code, and I can learn how a given program works (for the most part)
* I can't build a new robust cybersecurity/hacking tool from the ground up
* I am NOT a full fledge application developer, and I have no desire to become one
* I must keep coding to make sure I don't get rusty; I plan to do a challenge weekly
* I want to learn more programming languages, but not sure if I can dedicate the time to them (learning other skills is going to take priority)
