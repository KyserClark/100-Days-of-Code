I spent another hour on Python learning today. I wish I could have put more time in, but my school work has to take priority. 
I also spent a decent amount of time getting my website published. Technically at this time, it is publicly viewable, and that's a significant milestone for me. 
Soon I will tell the world that my website has been published. I can't wait!  

I watched and coded along with the final milestone project #1 walkthrough of the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla. I also officially began on my first milestone project. A working, playing Tic Tac Toe game! I can't wait to get it up and running. I know it will be challenging, but I'm electing not to use the guides provided with the course unless absolutely necessary. I think choosing the hard route will make me a better coder in the long run. 

Tomorrow I continue and hope to make significant progress on milestone project #1
