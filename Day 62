I Logged a very nice six hours into Python learning today. I made a lot of progress in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.  
I started out by finishing up Chapter 16: Downloading Data and completing Chapter 17: Working with APIs. 
Then moving on to Project 3:  Web Applications. I started and finished Chapter 18: Getting Started with Django. 
Tomorrow I will complete chapter 19: User Accounts and Chapter 20: Styling and Deploying an App.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 167.25 hours
