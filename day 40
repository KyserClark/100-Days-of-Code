A long day today; I logged in 7.5 hours into Python today. I started the day by finishing reading the PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code. 
Once I read it, I thought it would be a good idea to go back and re-style my Blackjack Game to match what the community deems as an acceptable format.
Then my focus was on changing the Sublime text editor settings to make it fit my needs. 
Then I read Chapter 5: If Statements in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes.
Straightforward chapter, even though it was just a review for me, I still completed all the "Try it yourself" sections. 
After I finished the chapter, I decided to download PyCharm and try it out. 
I instantly fell in love with it due to its integrated PEP 8 easy/auto-fixes. 
With this tool, all I have to do is code and not worry about my styling. I already like it more than Sublime. 
I'll use PyCharm for a while before I switch to a new IDE. I want to give a handful of IDEs a try to determine what IDE works best for me. 
I think PyCharm will be hard to beat, but we shall see. 
I've already customized it to my liking and tomorrow I will be off to the races when I start Chapter 6: Dictionaries!
