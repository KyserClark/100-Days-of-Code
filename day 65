I finally finished Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes! 
Once I finished it I immediately began the Python Network Programming for Network Engineers Udemy Course by David Bombal. 
I spent 2 hours trying to get GNS3 to work with Virtual Box. No success. I will try again tomorrow. 
If I am unable to get GNS3 working I will have to start a different Python course. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 174.25 hours
