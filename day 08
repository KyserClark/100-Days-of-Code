I only had time to do 1 hour of Python today because I had school work to do. However, I still managed to get valuable python time in.

Today I coded along in the the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.

I did
Introduction to Warm Up Project Exercises
Displaying Information
Accepting User Input
Validating User Input

Tomorrow I begin with Simple user Interaction and start my first Python Milestone Project Overview.
