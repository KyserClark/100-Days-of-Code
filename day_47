Truthfully, I didn't get a whole lot accomplished today. My tank is running on empty. My Advent of Cyber 2021 journey has taken a lot of my time. 
Editing YouTube videos take a long time and a lot of work, I'm exhausted, and to be frank, 
I would not have attempted to do a day of coding if I was not this far into my 100 days of code journey. I refuse to snap my streak. 
Today I continued with Chapter 9: Functions in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. 
I completed one exercise, but I'm currently stuck on one of the exercises. 
I think I will b able to solve it when I'm not so exhausted. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 134 hours
