It took me 1.5 hours to complete Chapter 8: Functions in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. 
Once again, very straightforward for me and had no real challenges. However, I do have a much greater understanding of importing modules. 
Tomorrow I will start Chapter 9: Classes.

I'm looking forward to this because this is the hardest part of Python for me. 
It will be good to see the information presented to me from a new perspective and get in some well-needed practice.  

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 131.5 hours
