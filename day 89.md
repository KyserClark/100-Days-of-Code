# Day 89

Today is actually a combination of two days. However, I didn't count yesterday because I only put in 30 hours of coding. The 100 Days of Code must be for at least an hour a day. Plus, I counted a 30-minute day earlier in my 100 days of code journey, so it's fair to count both of those half-hour days as one full day.

With that being said, yesterday, I started  Python 101 for Hackers. I watched Comprehensions, Lambdas, and Introduction to sys. 

Today within an hour, I watched the introduction to requests, introduction to pwntools, Project #1 - SSH login brute forcing, Project #2 - SHA256 password cracking, and Project #3 - Web login form brute forcing. Tomorrow I will Continue with Projects 4 & 5 to close the course. 

It's worth noting that I skipped all the basic introductory stuff of the course because I already know the basics of Python and how it works. I wanted to really focus on the content specifically made for hackers. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 229 hours
