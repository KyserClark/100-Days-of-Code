I Started the Alien Invasion Game Project in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes; 
today, I created a pygame window that responds to user input, set the background color, created a settings class, 
and added the ship image to the game window by creating the ship class and drawing the ship to the screen. Tomorrow I will continue with the project.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 147 hours
