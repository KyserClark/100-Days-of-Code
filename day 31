I put in 2 hours into Python learning today. I completed Python Regular Expressions Part Three, Timing Your Python Code, Zipping and Unzipping files with Python, 
and Advanced Python Module Puzzle in the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.  
Tomorrow I will Start Section 15: Web Scraping with Python.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 92 hours
