Today I put in 1.5 hours into Python learning. I didn't code anything today. 
Today was all about how to install packages and how to create my own modules and packages. 
Now I know that a program doesn't need to have all the code inside one file, 
and I can use multiple files/folders/directories to create an organized program. Neat!

Tomorrow I start with __name and "__main__" and then go into Errors and Exception Handling 
in the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 53.5 hours
