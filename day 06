I logged an incredible 9 hours (excluding breaks) in Python learning today. I spend the whole day learning how functions work and doing many coding exercises. 
However, there is still a lot to learn even though my knowledge of Python is growing. I don't know how to start applying this knowledge to the real world yet. 

I'm now 45% complete with the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.  

It still feels bizarre to code, but I will learn how to apply Python to the real world with time.
