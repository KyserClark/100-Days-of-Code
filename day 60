I have completed the Alien Invasion Game. I will admit, the code is not all mine. It's not a copy and paste. 
However, I did type it ALL out manually, following the project in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes step by step. 
I changed a few things about the game to make it my own, but not much. I learned a lot about game development in the past four days. 
I have a newfound respect for game developers. 
This code is a remake of a game developed in 1978 and it's ridiculous how much coding goes into such a simple game. 
I have concluded that I will never develop anything worth playing, and that's ok in my book. I'm a cybersecurity professional, not a game developer.
Once I completed Chapter 14: Scoring, I moved on to Project 2: Data Visualization. Probably more useful for my career than game development. 
I made it about a quarter of the way through Chapter 15: Generating Data.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 157 hours
