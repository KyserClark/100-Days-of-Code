Today I could only dedicate an hour to python learning due to school work deadlines and other competing priorities. 
So even though I already made a fully functional tic tac toe game, I wanted to go through the solutions to the project in the 
Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla. 
I watched the solution videos, and I realized that I could have made the tic tac toe game a little more efficient. 
However, there are some areas that I believe I did better in compared to the instructor's intended solutions. 
It's not a problem. The instructor even said his code would be different from mine if I decided to code out the project without looking at the solutions first during the lectures.
The primary goal was to get a fully working tic tac toe game without looking at the solutions and using minimal google search help. 

Tomorrow I will try to code out the intended solutions from memory. Meaning, I won't reference the solutions video while making my 2nd tic tac toe game. 
The only aid I will have is the workbook that helps layout the logic included in the project. I am enjoying the challenges with coding. 
I believe taking the challenging route is the best approach. It may take longer to get through the course, but in the end, I think it will make me be a better coder.
