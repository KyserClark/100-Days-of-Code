Today I put in 2.75 hours into Python Learning. I learned about Class Object Attributes and Methods, Inheritance and Polymorphism, and Special (Magic/Dunder) Methods. 

I also completed the Object-Oriented programming Homework with ease. 
This means I feel comfortable with the material in the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla. 

Tomorrow I will put these skills to the test by completing the Object-Oriented Programming challenge. 

Up to this point, I have dedicated 51 hours to python learning across 17 days.
