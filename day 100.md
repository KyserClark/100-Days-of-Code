# Day 100

For the last day of this challenge, I decided to complete a challenge on pythonprinciples.com/challenges/. The challenge I completed was the "Capital Indexes" challenge:

Write a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters.
For example, calling capital_indexes("HeLlO") should return the list [0, 2, 4].

My code that solved the challenge:

```
def capital_indexes(word):
    found = []
    last_index = -1
    for character in word:
        if character.isupper() == True:
            try:
                last_index = word.index(character, last_index+1)
            except ValueError:
                break
            else:
                found.append(last_index)
    return found
    
capital_indexes("HeLlO")
```

The example solutions:

```
# naive solution
def capital_indexes(s):
    upper = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    result = []
    for i, l in enumerate(s):
        if l in upper:
            result.append(i)
    return result

# shorter version
from string import uppercase
def capital_indexes(s):
    return [i for i in range(len(s)) if s[i] in uppercase]

# you can also use the .isupper() string method.
```

I'm glad I was able to solve it without the hints, and I'm glad that my code is very different than the intended solutions. Unfortunately, this took me about an hour to complete, so I'll have to continue to do a challenge at least once a week to keep my skills sharp.
