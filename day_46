Another hour of Python learning today! I continued Chapter 9: Functions in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes.
Unfortunately, I did not finish it. However, I did learn about a very valuable take when creating a child class. 
super() lets you truly inherit the parent's class attributes when creating a child class. This is extremely useful. 
Tomorrow I will continue with Chapter 9. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 133.5 hours
