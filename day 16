Today I only had time to put an hour into Python learning. 
I began with an introduction to object-oriented programming and learned about attributes and class keyword, followed by object attributes and methods. 
Tomorrow I will continue with object attributes and methods followed by Inheritance ad polymorphism in the 
Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.

So far I have committed 48.25 hours to python learning.
