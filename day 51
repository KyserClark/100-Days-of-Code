Today with the 1.5 hours I had, I continued Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.  
I spent some time familiarizing myself with Microsoft VS Code and wrote some simple programs dealing with exceptions while opening files. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 139.5 hours
