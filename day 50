Didn't get a chance to actually code today because when I loaded up PyCharm all my settings and menu disappeared. 
It was as if I was in a whole new IDE. I spend a good amount of time trying to make my settings and menu bars come back.
However, there wasn't a whole lot of support to fix my issue online. At least, there wasn't a simple solution. 
So, that frustration creates a new opportunity to try a new IDE. I downloaded and configured Microsoft Visual Studio Code with my remaining time. 
I have the new IDE ready to go for tomorrow. This seems to be a lot simpler to navigate compared to PyCharm. 
Which is good, although I will miss the PEP 8 suggestions in PyCharm. Maybe there is a plugin to get PEP 8 style suggestions in VS Code. 
Tomorrow I will continue Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. 
Normally I would try to produce some code, but I have an important paper to type for school, restricting me to only one hour in Python. 
(And I really shouldn't have done any kind of coding today, but I wanted to keep my 100 Days of Code Streak Alive).

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 137 hours
