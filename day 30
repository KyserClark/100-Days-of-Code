I put in another hour of Python learning today. Once again I had school work, and unfortunately, I turned my assignment in about 3 minutes late and it was not my best work. 
This is mostly due to the fact that I spent way too much time coding this weekend and neglected my schoolwork. 
Going forward, I will not code more than an hour until my schoolwork is done for the week.


Today I Completed the hands-on portion of Python Regular Expressions parts one, and two. And I watched part 3. 
Tomorrow I will code along for part 3 and then go into Timing Your Python Code in the Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 90 hours
