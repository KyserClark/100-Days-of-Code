With two hours available, I managed to get halfway through Chapter 8: Functions in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. 
Once again, not a new concept to me, but it is nice to get a review of functions. I'm getting very good at writing code correctly without many errors. 
I have a lot of fun doing this, and I love how I am getting better and more efficient. Tomorrow I will continue and complete Chapter 8.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 130 hours
