Great Day of Python! I haven't put in over 2 hours for a while. Today I logged 2.5 hours into Python. 
I first started out the day by switching my IDE back to PyCharm. I do like it more than Microsoft VS Code. 
I finished Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. And started Chapter 11: Testing Your Code. 
I'm learning tests that I didn't even know you could do, so that is very nice. 
Tomorrow I will continue and finish Chapter 11.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 143 hours
