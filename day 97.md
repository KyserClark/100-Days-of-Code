# Day 97

Today in one hour, I started and finished the Python for Pentesters room on TryHackMe. Tomorrow I plan on taking all the code I've written across the 100 days and putting it on my GitHub page. After that is complete, I plan on finding daily python practice challenges on the internet to keep my skills sharp.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 237 hours
