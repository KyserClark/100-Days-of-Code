I finally finished Chapter 9: Functions in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. 
A lot of interesting exercises explaining classes and how to import modules. 
I especially had fun programming the dice, and lottery_analysis programs. Tomorrow I will start Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions.

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 135.5 hours
