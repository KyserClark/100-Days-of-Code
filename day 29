I only had an hour to code today. Really, I shouldn't have even put in an hour since I have an important school project due tomorrow, 
but I needed to keep my 100 Days of Code streak alive. 
I'll still get the project done if I hit it hard first thing after work tomorrow, which should allow me for a decent amount of Python learning tomorrow. 


Today I went through Python Math and Random Modules, Python Debugger, and Python Regular Expressions Part One. 
Tomorrow I will re-watch and code along with the Part one video and continue on to part 2 and part 3 in the 
Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python Udemy Course by Jose Portilla.  

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 89 hours
