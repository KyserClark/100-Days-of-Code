I took another day off from coding yesterday. This is because I had some personal things to handle. 
However, it wasn't an entire day off because I still did my daily TryHackMe goal. 
However, today I managed to squeeze in 2 hours of reading Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. 
I read all of Chapter 7: Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions. 

I'll be honest, coding with Python has lost its charm. 
All the examples in the book and practice projects are programs that don't seem very useful to me. 
I have no idea how to create a useful program that fixes a problem. 
I don't want to waste my time coding something no one will use or something that already exists. 
I understand that it is good practice, but what am I practicing for? Reinventing the wheel? Nonsense. 
One day I will find a problem that I can solve with code, but I can't think of anything practical that hasn't already been made. 
So why should I reinvent the wheel with all these practice projects? How does one come up with a good program/application? 
Something to think about. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 212 hours
