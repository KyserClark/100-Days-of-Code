Today with 2.25 hours, I completed Chapter 3: Introducing Lists in the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes.

Most of the chapter was just a review for me, and I didn't learn much. However, I now know the difference between .sort() and sorted(). 
I also learned about del and .remove(). The exercises were simple but proved that I do understand the basics of lists.  
Tomorrow, on Thanksgiving, I will start with Chapter 4: Working with Lists. NO DAYS OFF!

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 110 hours
