Today in four hours I completed Chapter 15: Generating Data in Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. 
I continued and completed half of Chapter 16: Downloading Data. Tomorrow I will complete Chapter 16 and move on to Chapter 17: Working with APIs. 

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 161 hours
