Today I read Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart for an hour. I read the rest of chapter 19 and about half of chapter 20. 
Chapter 20 is particularly interesting because the book introduced the reader to mouse and keyboard automation. Good for graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Total Time Dedicated to Python Learning = 222 hours
